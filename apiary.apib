# marketgoo Provisioning API

The **marketgoo** API is based on REST principles and follows the recommendations
set forth in the [**json:api** specification](http://jsonapi.org).

The API end-point uses the domain configured as part of your **marketgoo** integration
with the `/api` prefix at the beginning of the path. We will use the domain
`app.acmeseo.com/api` as an example end-point domain through this documentation, but
remember to use your assigned production domain.


# Content types and the json:api basics

The **json:api** specification requires all data to be **JSON**. This means all returned
entities and requests must be made as **JSON** objects. You are required to use the
`Accept:` header with a mime type of `application/vnd.marketgoo.api+json` to be considered
a valid **json:api** request.

The `Content-Type` header is also required to be a mime type of `application/vnd.marketgoo.api+json`,
but for the `Content-Type` header we also allow for you to use `application/json` if you
find it difficult to override the standard **JSON** mime type of your library.


# Authentication

All calls to the **marketgoo** API must be SSL secured. Also, all API requests must
be authenticated by using the `X-Auth-Token` header. You must use the provided
**API Key** in this header.

> ### Important note
>
> This **API Key** provides you with administrative privileges to freely create, delete
> and manage accounts without restriction so it is very important for your provision
> software to **keep this API Key as secured as possible**.

> We will use `1234567890abcdef` as a dummy API Key through this documentation.
> Please be sure to use our provided **API Key** in production.

A sample request to the `/api/accounts` endpoint might look like:

```
GET /api/accounts HTTP/1.1
Host: app.acmeseo.com
X-Auth-Token: 1234567890abcdef
Accept: application/vnd.marketgoo.api+json
```


# Pre-signed public Authentication

There might be some times you will need to pre-authorize external libraries to access a
certain account to read Data API information (see "Data API features" below). Some examples
might include a WordPress Plugin, a cPanel host or some script you want to give Data API
access **without exposing the private API Key**.

The call to "Get single account" at `GET /api/account/<UUID>` (see below) accepts an
`Authorization` header like in the following example:

```
GET /api/accounts/<UUID> HTTP/1.1
Host: app.acmeseo.com
Authorization: Bearer <Pre-signed JWT Token>
Accept: application/vnd.marketgoo.api+json
```

The `<Pre-signed JWT Token>` bearer is similar in concept to an **OAuth2 permanent token**.
Your provision software can **sign this token using the API Key** and pass it along
the `<UUID>` to the external software. Then this external software is free to store the
token and use it in the `Authentication:` header to access the account information.

JWT stands for "JSON Web Tokens", and it's a RFC 7519 standard for representing claims.
Please see the [RFC-7519 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) and the
[JWT website](https://jwt.io) for more information.

To construct the JWT token needed for this authentication, please use the **HMACSHA256**
algorithm to sign the JWT body using your **API Key** as secret. The body of the JWT needs
to include the `uuid` field as shown below:

```
{
    "uuid": <UUID>
}
```

There are several libraries to handle JWT tokens, please see the [JWT website](https://jwt.io)
for more information. Here you can see an example using PHP with the Firebase JWT library:

```
<?php

// Use your preferred JWT library. Firebase used as example.
use Firebase\JWT\JWT;

// Pre-sign the JWT using your API Key with "HS256" algorithm
$bearer = JWT::encode([
    "uuid" => "1cbd65c81e6462906c8f4eaf02417d3cae667ffb"
], "1234567890abcdef", "HS256");

echo $bearer.PHP_EOL;
?>

---

Expected output:
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1dWlkIjoiMWNiZDY1YzgxZTY0NjI5MDZjOGY0ZWFmMDI0MTdkM2NhZTY2N2ZmYiJ9.AslfPa8csfWO65asCfr79ErVgrrCPzeuG7LC1GH__vE

```

Using the Bearer from the above example, you can make a request to `GET /api/accounts/<UUID>`
as follows:

```
GET /api/accounts/<UUID> HTTP/1.1
Host: app.acmeseo.com
Accept: application/vnd.marketgoo.api+json
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1dWlkIjoiMWNiZDY1YzgxZTY0NjI5MDZjOGY0ZWFmMDI0MTdkM2NhZTY2N2ZmYiJ9.AslfPa8csfWO65asCfr79ErVgrrCPzeuG7LC1GH__vE
```


# Pagination

Requests that may return several items are paginated. You can paginate by using the `page`
object as specified in the [**json:api** specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination).

Pages are specified by `page[limit]` and `page[offset]` parameters. `page[limit]` specifies
how many items you want in each page. By default we return **100** items per page, with a
upper limit of **1000** items. The `page[offset]` parameter specifies the first item to
fetch. The **offset** is zero based, and it works pretty much like the `limit` / `offset`
parameters of a SQL Query.

For example, to get the first page of items where each page contains 10 items you might use:

`page[limit]=10 & page[offset]=0`

To get the second page:

`page[limit]=10 & page[offset]=10`

To help you with pagination, each response of a paginated request contains a `meta` object
holding meta data about the pagination and a `links` object containing links to the **next**,
**previous**, **first** and **last** pages.

Example `meta` and `links` object from a paginated response:

```
{
    "data": [
        ...
    ],
    "meta": {
        "total_items": 100,
        "total_pages": 10
    },
    "links": {
        "first": "https://app.acmeseo.com/api/accounts?page[limit]=10&page[offset]=0",
        "last": "https://app.acmeseo.com/api/accounts?page[limit]=10&page[offset]=90",
        "prev": null,
        "next": "https://app.acmeseo.com/api/accounts?page[limit]=10&page[offset]=10"
    }
}
```

> **NOTE** The example query parameters above use unencoded `[` and `]` characters simply
> for readability. In practice, these characters must be percent-encoded, per the
> requirements in [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4).


# Product and product add-on tokens

The list of available products and add-ons will vary upon your partnership contract with
marketgoo. We use the example product token `evolution` and an example add-on token
`keyword10` only for documentation purposes. You can view your actual list of available
product and add-on tokens by using the "**General information**" operations "**Get available
products**" and "**Get available product add-ons**" in the reference below.


## Getting general information [/api/me]

The following actions retrieves information about your current configuration such as
the **Company Name** used to show to your customers, the **Production Domain**, etc.

The information contained in this calls should be considered confidential, as they might
contain information related to the branding contract. E.G. Product portfolio, prices, etc.

## Working with accounts [/api/accounts]

Use the following API calls to work with accounts. You can create, get, update and delete accounts.

The call to "**Get multiple accounts**" returns a paginated response as specified in the **Pagination**
section above.

Every account can be in three different states, as stated in the following table:

| Status      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `active`    | The account is fully active and in a working state Accounts in **active** state counts towards your monthly billing invoice. |
| `inactive`  | Accounts in **inactive** state have been deleted. We don't really delete accounts when issuing a `DELETE` API operation. Instead, we keep the account in **inactive** state in order to keep a historic log. Accounts in **inactive** state doesn't count towards your monthly billing invoice. |
| `suspended` | Accounts in **suspended** state are active (they still count as **active** for your monthly billing invoice) and still working doing scans, etc, but they are deactivated for the user. This is a special state that triggers a warning screen to the user showing something is happening with the account. It is useful if you want to warn your users about failed payments, or special events that should render the account suspended for a limited period. |

You can use the `filter[status]` parameter to query for different Account status.

## Update vs. Upgrade

Note that "updating" is not the same as "upgrading" an account. The "update" operation as specified in `Update account` below is only meant to change some properties like `name`, `email`, etc.

## Upgrading or downgrading accounts [/api/accounts/{uuid}/upgrade]

Use this operation to upgrade or downgrade an account to use a different product. The above operation
for **"Update account"** does not allow to switch product tiers.

For an upgrade to be successful, the account must fulfill the constrains of the new product. For instance,
upgrading from a product with 4 allowed keywords to a product with only 2 allowed keywords will fail if
the user is currently using all of the 4 allowed slots for keywords.

In these cases you can use the `force` attribute to `true` to allow for automatic degradation and the
system will automatically delete the excess keywords.

**Note for anonymous products:** Anonymous products like those with token "zero" can be created without a user email. In case you want to upgrade any anonymous plan, you need to assign a user email to it before with a [UPDATE](https://marketgoo.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/working-with-accounts/update-account) call.

### Upgrade / Downgrade account [PATCH /api/accounts/{uuid}/upgrade]

## Managing Keywords [/api/accounts/{uuid}/keywords]

A keyword is a word (or phrase) from which people might find a website when used as a query in search engines like Google.
With this calls you can retrieve, add or remove the tracked keywords from an account.

The amount of keywords you can track for your account is defined by the product limits. If you try to add more than the allowed you will receive a 409 error telling you've reached your account limits. Remove one of your keywords to make room for the new one.

## Managing end user logins to the App [/api/accounts/{uuid}/login]

To properly log a user into the Application you must obtain a Single Sign On URL so that you can provide the
user with a button or link to click and access the Application. For instance, you can obtain a SSO link
each time a user logs into your hosting control panel to provide a **[Manage your SEO]** button or menu.

You can get two different SSO links, permanent and expiring:

* Permanent tokens **(Recommended only for internal hosting panels)** will give you a permanent login URL,
meaning that this link will not expire. You can use this public URL and cache it so that you can login the
user in the future. There is no personal or critical information in the link, but anyone with access to the
link would be able to log in to the application. This is why this link method is recommended only for your
hosting panels, and not for emails.

* Expiring tokens **(Recommended for emails)** will give you a token link with an expiration time in minutes.
The available range in minutes is 5 to 1440 (24 hours). This link will be valid for login for the entire range,
starting from the time the call was issued. This is a better option for sending the login URL to the user in
emails, because anyone with access to the email will only be able to log into the application while the token
is valid.

## Working with SEO Reports [/api/reports]

SEO Reports are one shot reports about a website. They don't require an active account and all reports
are public and viewable for everyone without requiring to log in. SEO Reports are also shared
(multi tiered) so an SEO Report for a certain website might have been created already by other user.

The public nature of our SEO Reports leads to the following main characteristics:

* An SEO Report is a **one shot report** to check the SEO performance of a Website.
* Every SEO Report is **public and viewable for everyone**, even when created from the private API.
* Each SEO Report is cached for **15 days**. In other words, a new request for a report for the same website returns
the same data for the next 15 days after the first request, in which time the SEO Report is generated again.
* Each SEO Report is then **saved forever** (no date of expiration), so you must recreate each SEO Report to
reflect the new SEO performance every 15 days.
* The SEO Score for a SEO Report might or **might not** be the same as the Score stated in a SEO Plan,
although chances are the Score is the same or very close to.
* Creating an SEO Report, either new or refreshing a new one, will take aproximately from 5 to 10 minutes,
depending on the speed of the checked website.

### Create SEO Report [POST /api/reports]

Sending a POST request to create a new SEO Report will yield one of two different objects:

* If the request will CREATE a new SEO Report, or will REFRESH an existent SEO Report, it
returns a `202 Accepted` status code and creates a new "SEO Report Request" (returned in the
body payload and in the `Content-Location` header). You are required to **poll** the endpoint
returned in the `Content-Location` header regularly until the Report is created.
(See "Get SEO Report Request Status")

## Data API features [/api/accounts/{uuid}]

Data API is an optional service included in a higher tier from the standard marketgoo API. The data scheme of the Data API
provides deeper and richer information on every account.

For further information ask our **Business Development** team at [partners@marketgoo.com](mailto:partners@marketgoo.com)

Basically, with **Data API** enabled, you can get the current snapshot of all of the data
gathered for the website, from the actual Scores to the list of all the tasks. This gives
you an incredible opportunity to enrich the user experience into your internal user control panels.

These are some of the most useful data fields you can obtain from our Data API:

| Field | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `created_at` | Date the account was created. |
| `product` | Type of product under marketgoo portfolio. |

Request information about the existence of a responsive or dedicated mobile page with `dedicated` and `responsive` . |
| `progress` | Provides information about marketgoo propietary score separated by marketing area. `global` is the end value when `global_onpage` is the score for onpage SEO and the rest of the score parameters are `visitors`, `sitereview`, `search`, `onpage`, `popularity`, and `mobile`. |
| `progress.overview` | Some useful KPI's to populate your end: `audit`, `optimize`, `popularity`, `pages_pending`, `pages_completed` |
| `tasks` | Tasks are the number of recommendations our solution provides to the site owner. We provide data on the total number of tasks, the completed ones, pending, manual tasks and tasks with warnings. There are different parameters to gather specific user behaviour on tasks. For example `configurecomp` let you know if the user has fill any competitor. Other interesting task data includes `wwwspeed`as loading time or `sslexists`to check site SSL configuration. Please refer to the list of tasks in the example or ask for detailed information. |
| `keywords` | This group provides information about keyword data including `search_volume` and `rankings` data on Google, Yahoo and BING. The `snippet` one shows meta information on the different search engine queries. |
